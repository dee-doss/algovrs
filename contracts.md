## üîß INTEGRATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Core Problem System
1. Replace mock data in `ProblemList.jsx` with API calls
2. Update `ProblemDetail.jsx` to fetch real problem data
3. Implement code execution and submission system
4. Update progress tracking in dashboard

### Phase 2: User System
1. Add authentication flow
2. Real user profiles and progress tracking
3. Personal submission history
4. User-specific problem status (solved/attempted)

### Phase 3: Contest System
1. Real contest management
2. Live leaderboards
3. Contest participation and ranking
4. Contest problem submissions

## üéØ IMMEDIATE BACKEND TASKS
1. **MongoDB Models** - Problems, Users, Submissions, Contests
2. **Authentication** - JWT-based auth with bcrypt password hashing
3. **Problem CRUD** - Full problem management system
4. **Code Execution** - Integrate with code execution service
5. **User Progress** - Real-time progress tracking and statistics

## üåü CURRENT FEATURES WORKING
- ‚úÖ Responsive navigation and header
- ‚úÖ Problem filtering and search (frontend logic)
- ‚úÖ Problem detail view with examples/constraints  
- ‚úÖ Code editor with language switching
- ‚úÖ Dashboard with user stats and progress
- ‚úÖ Contest system UI (upcoming/past contests)
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive design
- ‚úÖ Clean, modern UI matching LeetCode design

The frontend is **fully functional with mock data** and provides an excellent user experience that closely replicates LeetCode's functionality and design!
